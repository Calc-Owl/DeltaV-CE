DELTAV CE

About:

This program is designed to calculate Delta-V using exhaust velocity. The equation used is a very simple and purely theoretical form of the rocket equation. It does not take into account air friction, etc.

Purpose:

You can use this program to better understand how information is derived from the rocket equation and how the change in mass over time impacts the overall velocity of a vehicle.

Instructions:

Input the mass of the vehicle including fuel. Input the mass of the vehicle completely empty (without fuel or any mass that will be jettisoned in the course of launch). Input the exhaust velocity of engines (input the sum of all engines for multi-engine vehicles). The typical Ve is between 2000-3500 m/s, but you can calculate whatever value you like. 

Units:

All units are metric and the formulas in the back have been designed to compute using these forms. Clever units are provided so students learning the subject are not needlessly confused by units.
